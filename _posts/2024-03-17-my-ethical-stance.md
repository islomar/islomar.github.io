I'm currently in a "relaxed" search of new professional challenges. By "relaxed" I mean that I have not openly published it and I'm not intensively searching: for the moment, I just knocked a couple of doors (from people/companies I feel a high level of alignment) and got into a couple of processes from people who directly approached to me (I'm such a privileged person and I feel SO FUCKING LUCKY üòç).

Still, this is a moment where I have asked myself once again questions like:
- What kind of industries do I feel specially motivated to join?
- What kind of industries or business models or organizational behaviour I don't want to join?
- What are my "ethical red lines"? How big is the "grey area" on that matter?

This is not the first time that I pose myself this kind of questions. I remembered that Edu Ferro (a reference to me in so many ways) has his own ["ethical stance" published here](https://www.eferro.net/p/to-be-happy-and-make-those-around-me.html), so I thought it would be a perfect moment to write down mine. And I want to be so specific as possible; otherwise it would be useless for myself.

For different reasons (i.e. there are higher and lower levels of "criticality" in this list) and with no particular order and not being an exhaustive list, **I don't want to work on**:

- Fast fashion (and anything directly related)
- Traditional banks (especially those with proven record of abuses and illegalities)
- ‚ÄúBuy now, pay later‚Äù or any kind of "fast credit" business models
- Porn industry
- Military industry
- Casinos, gambling and bets ("been there, done that")
- Any green-washing, or generally speaking, ‚Äúethical-washing‚Äù activity
- Crypto businesses and alike
- Delivery riders business models where they get abused, usually as "false freelances"
- Business models whose main goal is encouraing wild consumerism of any kind
- Anything where there is no full transparency about the business model and how they earn money
- Any activity without full honesty: lying, cheating, hiding relevant information or ‚Äútricking‚Äù their users, providers, employees, etc.


I'm writing this mainly as a **reminder for myself**, I'm not here to tell anyone what they should do, to give moral lessons nor to distribute any kind of "licenses". Life is hard and I have enough with setting my own compass moral üòÖ

And I write these words being fully conscious about my own incoherences: with the current complexity of the world and society, I don't think that it's possible to live on it being "fully coherent". Sometimes I would even say that it isn't "healthy". Long life to the [cognitive dissonances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance)! üòÜ

No matter how I much I tried to reduce it, I'm very aware that I am part of the global community that often and continuously exploits other regions/people. Shame on me. Shame on us.

Regarding some topics, my views have evolved in the past, and I hope they will continue to do so in the future. Still, I'm not always in peace with that, which I think is good üôè
