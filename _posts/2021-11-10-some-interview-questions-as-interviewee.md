This post is the extraction of a section at my page [My professional services](../../my-professional-services).
Some people enjoyed this part especially, so I thought it might be a good idea to extract it as an independent post that I might update from time to time.

The goal of these questions is to help clarifying my **expectations** and to generate the clearest and broadest possible idea about the company, the business, the culture, the role, the day-to-day work, etc. To better grab the "lights" and the "darkness". Another outcome is to **reduce the probability of a misalignment and big surprises** during the first weeks of work ðŸ˜Š

So... here I share some of the questions that I have asked in the past or I will ask in the future to my interviewers:

- What is your **mission** and short-term goals as an organisation? What is your **vision** and long-term goals?
- What is the **business model** of the company? Who are your customers, users, providers?
- What **differentiates** you from any other company and from your competitors?
- **How do you earn money**, what are your **revenue streams**? Did you surpass the break-even?
- How do you **improve** as a company or team? How do you **learn**?
- How are you **organised**? (company-wide and engineering)
- How do you take **decision**s? Who takes which ones and when? What decisions are taken at each "level"?
- How do you **communicate**? How do you get **feedback** in all the needed directions?
- How do you keep the whole organisation **aligned**?
- Do you consider the company a **remote-first** one? E.g. is there any company or team event which does not happen online? Can I enjoy my own local bank holidays? Will you pay for any expense related with an on-site gathering?
- Are there explicit actions in place to take care about **Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I)**? E.g. do you have numbers about gender diversity? About age diversity? What about diversity in leadership and management positions (C-level included)?
- What do you **enjoy** the most from working there?
- Tell me something that you don't like here. What room for improvement exists? What would you like to be different, why and how?
- What are the current main **challenges** for the company? (product and technical challenges)
- Why would you **fire me**?
- **Psychological safety** is extremely important to me, so please be honest with me: are there verbally aggressive people, especially in positions with power?
- Is there **micromanagement** from any position with power (e.g CTO/VP/Head/Managers)? How do they intervene in team's decisions if they don't agree?
- What would be my **boundaries**? What wouldn't I be allowed to do or to step into?
- What do you **expect** from me?
- Why don't you cover this position with a current internal employee?
- Do you have a structured **onboarding** plan for me?
- Who would be **my manager**? I would like to talk to them and understand their vision and expectations about me.
- Why did the last 2 people of Engineering left? How did you handle it?
- Why did the last 2 people of Engineering were fired (or made redundant ðŸ˜‰)? How did you handle it?
- How do you take **care** of people?
- Can I talk to any **potential peer**, specially someone already doing the same work? Can I talk with a team?
- What does a **team** look like there?
- How would you describe your **ideal colleague**? And your ideal team?
- Who decides how a team works? ("rituals", principles, practices, roles, etc.)
- What does **"technical/engineering excellence"** mean to you?
- Tell me about your **infrastructure and platform**. What is automated? Can the "external product teams" deploy on their own?
- Tell me about your **observability** practices. How do you find out that there is a problem? How do you dig deeper to solve it?
- What happens when an incident in Production is detected?
- Tell me about your main **technical principles and practices**.
- What is approximately your **lead time** (time from a commit to Production), **throughput** (deployments/releases to Production) and **error rate**?
- Could you tell me which is the whole lifecycle of a **user need**? Could you describe for me any of your main **value streams**? From the discovery of the user need until its satisfaction.
- How and when is the **priorization** done? Who does it? Based on what?
- How do you optimize the **business and technical alignment of the teams**?
- What happens from the moment a developer starts working on something until it is deployed? Could you please describe to me your **delivery pipeline**? What's the full **journey of a commit**?
- How many teams does a team depend on to get a small change into production?
- What is the entire process for a **one line change** in code to make it to production? (by [Jeremy Kahne](https://twitter.com/jeremykahne/status/1469416655168196620))
- Do you decouple **"Release"** from "Deployment"?
- What is a **typical day** of a team? (from the very start to the very end)
- Do you support **open source** in any way?
- How does the whole **recruitment process** work? Which will be the next steps?
- What is the **salary range**? Social benefits?
- Is there any **budget** for training or any other concept?
- Would there be the possibility to work **30-32 hours per week** (6 hours per day or 4 days per week)?
