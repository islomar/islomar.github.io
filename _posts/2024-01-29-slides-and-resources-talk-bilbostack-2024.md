Some months ago, the organization of the amazing conference [BilboStack](https://bilbostack.com/) made the mistake of inviting me to talk to the 2024 edition üòÜ

I decided to talk about **Continuous Deployment**... as a Trojan horse in order to talk about many other topics related with software and product development (probably too many indeed! üòÖ)

Last Saturday, 27th January 2024, I finally gave it: ["Valor por encima de c√≥digo: el poder del Despliegue Continuo"](https://bilbostack.com/isidro-lopez), which might be translated to English as "Value over Code: the power of Continuous Deployment".

Here I would like to share the slides and some of the people and resources included in the talk üôè
