_Disclaimer_: this post has been written entirely by a human being ðŸ¤£

A mix of some things that I have found and lots of missing things.

1. Publish the salary
1. Offer 20% of time for candidate's questions DURING the interview (not with a "you can send us your questions by email").
1. Ask for feedback to the candidate AFTER every interview.
 - "Oh, but that would be useless because XXXX"
 - If you don't like it, do not show "iron fist, crystal jaw"
1. Live coding interview: stressing enough. Share in advance so much as possible, it should not be a trap! Kind of exercise, what you will value, etc. And a crazy idea: let people do the exercise in the most similar way to REALITY. That means: use their preferred local IDE and any kind of support, ChatGPT, AI agents, Google, whatever!
1. Always 2 people in the interview. Peer reviews.
1. Be coherent! And don't waste people's times
1. Questions beyond hard skills. Values, from the beginning, don't wait until a last "Cultural Fit" interview, that's a waterfall approach to something which should be like the "quality-in" Lean Principle: present all the time.
1. When discarding a candidate after having started the process, always offer proactively to share feedback with them. Both positive and improvement. With empathy and assertiveness, you don't know what battle is that person going through, especially if they are in a situation of search for a job.
    - Learn to give constructive feedback. Most people don't know how to do it without falling into disrespectful messages. Your best intentions are far from enough, remember: the path to the hell is paved with good intentions.
1. Show interest to the candidate's vision about whatever matters for the role and position. Active listening.
1. Aim for balance, do your best to minimize the asymmetric power dynamics that happens. 

No matter the offer and demand of the moment, no matter if there is a lack of professionals or a saturated market: show RESPECT, EMPATHY and CARE.
