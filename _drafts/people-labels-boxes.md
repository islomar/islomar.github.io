Amazing that most companies, people, recruiters, managers have difficulties to REALLY understand that someone might be interested in several or many things: many different technologies, different roles, different industries, etc.

A sign of "lack of focus" or not having clear what you want...

People like labels, boxes, categorizing. Simplicity. Their heads burst

I contain multitudes.

My case: Telecommunications Engineering, Senior Engineering Manager, 5 different technologies, consultancy, public organization, start-ups, scale-ups, Social and Cultural Anthropology, Psychology, Script writing. Let alone sports.

No se ve la riqueza.
