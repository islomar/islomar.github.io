Every time I arrive to a new company or team, one of the many tasks that I get myself doing is xxxx.

The goal of this post, which I will continuously update, is to have in a single place the main resources that xxxx.

Although the goal of this post is not to explain what vertical slicing is and its benefits, I will do a quick and hypersimplified review of it:

Story slicing , but this could "vertical slicing" or "horizontal slicing".

- **Horizontal slicing**: xxx
- **Vertical slicing**: xxx

## TODO
- INVEST
- Talk at Clarity (2023-03-27))
  - It includes reasons, benefits, etc.
- Review story slicing workshop from Chris and Kevin
- Uses Story Mapping
- Opportunity cost
- Cost of Delay, CD3
- Technical slicing
- In order to enable and get the benefits, you need some practices (XP and Lean), parallel changes, continuous delivery/deployment, deferring commitment, simplicity, a design that enables (e.g. ports and adapters aka "hexagonal architecture" or some patterns from DDD), etc.
- Why we "need" stories
    - Bridge business-technical communication
    - Focus on user value over tech specs
    - Enable iterative delivery & feedback
    - Support priorization (re-priorization)
    - Track progress - timelines & estimates
- What is slicing? Getting to the smallest possible thing we can have a conversation about. "What can we do today, that can be used tomorrow?" That can make tomorrow easier for customers, users or us.
